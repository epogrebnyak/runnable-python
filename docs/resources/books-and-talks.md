## Short references

[QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) and [Scipy Lectures](https://scipy-lectures.org/) make a quick introduction to Python before jumping to bigger topics in quantitative and scientific modelling.

## Style guides

Two big ones: 

- [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

Small old gems:

- [Best of the Best Practices (BOBP)](https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839)
- [Dmitry Mugtasimov's notes](https://dmugtasimov-tech.blogspot.com/2016/12/my-python-software-development-practices.html)

## Renowned speakers

- Raymond Hettinger. [Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go) and [Beyond PEP-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) as mentioned above.
- [James Powell. So You Want to Be a Python Expert?](https://pyvideo.org/pydata-seattle-2017/so-you-want-to-be-a-python-expert.html)

## Programming classics 

[**"The C Programming Language"**][kr] by Kernighan and Ritchie (1978) is a classic in technical writing and a foundational piece of computer literature.

[kr]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language

From [**"The Mythical Man-Month"**][mmm] (MMM) by Fred Brooks (1975), a classic in software engineering and project management, we know that there is no silver bullet, adding more people to a late software project makes it worse, and other laws and adages that still hold true today.

[mmm]: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/2018-481/readings/mythical-man-month.pdf

[**"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"**][sicp] (SICP) by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman (1985) is an influential text that can convince skeptics that programming is a science but also at risks deterring you from programming for life.

[sicp]: https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf

<div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top: 8px">

Hint: Read on the MMM, glance through the SICP table of contents, and get a table copy of K&R.

## Blogs

1. _programming is terrible_ blog posts could have really made a good book together.
    Around the same time Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky released their blog series as books. 
   Still prefer _tef_'s writing and hope he is doing well despite of a pessimistic blog title. 

   - [Write code that’s easy to delete, and easy to debug too](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-thats-easy-to-delete-and-easy-to-debug).
   - [Repeat yourself, do more than one thing, and rewrite everything](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/repeat-yourself-do-more-than-one-thing-and-rewrite-everything).
   - [Write code that’s easy to delete, and easy to debug too.](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/173883533613/code-to-debug)
   - [How I write software](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/how-i-write-software).

2. _"Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them"_ and 119 other 
   [perilisms](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html) 
   by Alan Perlis. 
   
   Not to confuse with great other books - the [Programming Pearls](https://jj09.net/programming-pearls/) by Jon Bentley or 
   [Book fo Why](https://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by Judea Pearl and Dana MacKenzie.

3. [Write unmaintainable code - enure a job for life](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code) by Roedy Green.

## Glossaries

- [Devil's Dictionary of Programming (2013).](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/65781074112/devils-dictionary-of-programming)
- [IBM Jargon and General Computing Dictionary (1990).](https://havantcivicsociety.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ibmjarg.pdf)

## Talks

Software is hard:

- [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4) Bret Victor.
- [The Art of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czzAVuVz7u4) by Dylan Beattie.
- [Why Can't We Make Simple Software?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czzAVuVz7u4) by Peter van Hardenberg.

Social is hard:

- [Julie Pagano. It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY) - mental health, inclusivity and making tech a better place.

## Tired of it?

Sometimes it worth switching your attention to other knowledge areas and 
domains away from programming. Several suggestions:

- **[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcRFOAKl3OY)** by Robert Sapolsky (1994).
- **[The Last Lecture: Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo)** by Randy Pausch (2007).

Ask your favorite LLM what might be the third title on this list. Names like [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl), [Erich Fromm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm), [Malcolm Gladwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell),
and [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) may appear.

Also suggesting [Philosophy of Science](https://finec.mgimo.ru/blog/rafaela-medeiros-philosophy-interview/) guest interview with Rafaela Medeiros,
where I'm the interview host.
