# Can I use an LLM for this course?

We encourage using a large language model (LLM) 
of your choice such as
[Deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/)
[Mistral](https://www.mistral.ai/),
[Gigachat](https://giga.chat/)
or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
for explaining the code you wrote yourself
but not for genertaing answeres to the exercises.

As a competent human you have to control the start 
and the end of an LLM dialogue: telling what to do 
and being able to see if the output is satisfactory. 
You retain the "think what to do" and "decide if it is right"
parts to yourself, but delegate other tasks to an LLM:

- explain why is this code not running,
- how can I enhance this code and make it more idiomatic,
  what ar eyour refactoring suggestions?
- what are similar programming excercises for me to practice?

More simply put, you cannot cheat your way through 
learning programming and simply telling an LLM "Do my job".
If the job is done right, you will be replaceable by AI.
If the job not done right, someone who knows programming 
will need to finish or redo it. 

After you complete the initial programming excercises 
you will see some tasks that encourage
you enhance your code through an LLM by giving specific 
instructions and performing the checks.
