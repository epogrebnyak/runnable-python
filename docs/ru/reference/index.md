# Reference

Welcome to the Reference section of The Python Guide 2025. Here you will find detailed information and resources to help you understand various Python concepts and tools.

## Programs as sequences of commands

Few remarks that help adjust our view of a program before we dive into more detail:

- Each line in a program is typically a **statement** — a command to perform an action
  or running a calculation. Statements can also span multiple lines.

- Python uses **indentation** with extra spaces to define code blocks. Consistent indentation is required in Python to avoid errors.

- You will learn to repeat a code block using **loops** and choose alternatives for program flow using **conditional statements**, or "branching".

- **Comments** in code provide additional information to the reader but do not affect program execution.

- **Functions** and **classes** are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in organizing and maintaining the code in a modular fashion.

- You do need to write all of the code yourself — maybe there is already **library** or a **package** for your task. Maybe programming is just about connecting the dots porperly in services created and run by other people or organizations.
