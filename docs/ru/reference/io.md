# Input and output

## Console

We `print()` to screen and we ask for `input()` from the keyboard.

### `print()`

- Prints one or more values to screen.
- `print("Hellow, world!"")` is a classic greeting.
- Used in real programs.

## `input()`

- Reads a string from the keyboard - everything you type before hitting "Enter".
- Remember to check input or convert to a number when necessary.
- Not so often used in real programs and slightly overused in teaching.

## Files

Read a local file, write to a local file. Much easier now with `pathlib.Path`.

## Web

Make a web request to fetch data from internet using `httpx` or `requests`.

## Remote APIs

Now we want some structured answer to our request please.

## Command line arguments

How about a program `python greet.py --name "Yours truely"`?
