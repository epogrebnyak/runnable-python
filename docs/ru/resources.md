# Ресурсы

The **Python Guide 2025** is designed to support this workflow for individual or group learning, whether at school, in a university class, or in vocational training. We hope to follow up with national language versions of this course, including Hindi, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic, Spanish, French and Russian.

## Dilemmas in Programming Education

- The better you talk, the more students listen, the less they do.
- Seems like a mountain to beginners, dull after you have learnt it.
- Unclear why people do not understand something what seems natural to you.
- So many resources, so little progress.
- Still payoffs to gatekeeping. Quite a bit of toxicity.
- Not as much student motivation to explore things as one may expect.
- Geniuine surprise "Is it that simple?"
- So much money wasted on paid courses. Free courses may not be appreciated.
- The curse of videos, tutorial hell and lack of progress.
- ChatGPT can do most beginner exercises better than beginners.
- Returns to education of long-term.
- Teaching This is hard.

## Ideas Behind the Guide

- common textbook with excercises that allows to cover basics
- speciliasation after this course
- distill better and non-trivial examples
- better pedagogy
- make students do something, min no passi
- less prose
- linked to resources
- has point of work - a little excercise in browser window
- language reference \* pporject tasks (each project has mapping to required)
- targeting the gap after "well I knwo syntax what next"
- generally what to tune up level of teaching to non-tehc audience
- lower the barriers - no student left behind
- maybe teach the minimal subset of Python no to distract attention
