# Practice Beginner Exercises

- **Who is this course for?** Anyone who wants to 
  practice Python coding excercises without setting 
  up a programming environment.

- **Can I study it myself?** Better works as a guided course 
  with an instructor or a mentor, so check out the announcements 
  for the open sessions.

- **Can I use your excercises in my class?** As a teacher, 
  you may [freely use this material](/terms-of-use) for your own course
  and also [provide feedback](/feedback) if your students liked it.

- **Can I use an LLM?** We encourage using a large language model (LLM) 
  of your choice such as
  [Deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/)
  [Mistral](https://www.mistral.ai/),
  [Gigachat](https://giga.chat/)
  or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
  for explaining the code you wrote yourself
  but not for genertaing answeres to the exercises.

- **Are there any translations?**. Soon for the Kyzgyz and Russian languages.

Before starting a big journey, remember:

> A tree too big to embrace is created from the tiniest shoot.  
> A terrace of nine stories rises from a pile of dirt.  
> A journey of a thousand miles begins from under the feet.
