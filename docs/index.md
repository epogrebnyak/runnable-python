# From `greet()` to grade

**Build you own test for the course.** 
Start from printing text to screen and taking the user input. 
Progress to developping a small but logically complete program 
that can administer and assess your final exam.

**Make building blocks**. Each exercise is a building block 
for the final application and a step in learning 
Python syntax and new programming concepts.
Use [a course checklist](/resources/student-checklist)
to follow up on these topics.

**Read the docs**. For preparation visit the Python 
[official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/#) 
including the *Tutorial* and the *Python Standard Library* sections.

**Use LLMs wisely**. We encourage you to write you own code
and _after that_ use larger language models (LLMs) to enhance
Check out models like 
[Deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/),
[Mistral](https://www.mistral.ai/),
[GigaChat](https://giga.chat/) and
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
before the course start.

## Run code now

**All in your browser**. Your exercises at this website 
will be in boxes where you can run and edit 
provided short code examples and create your own code.

The code runs in your browser — you do not need to install any other software
on your computer for this course!

Run the code below using the ▶️ button.
Press `Enter` after typing your answer.
Make your changes to the code and run it again.

```python
# This is a demo program (this line is a comment)

print("Your course begins soon...")
print("Are you ready to start?")
answer = input("Type your answer and press Enter: ")
print("Proceeding next with your", answer, "answer.")
```

::: details Ready for some excercises?

Depending on your level of programming experience 
you may be able to do the following tasks.

1. Translate the messages to other spoken language.
2. Can you spot where the variable `answer` is used?
   You can change the variable name `answer` to `response` 
   and make sure the program runs again.
3. Print a message `Your answer was` followed by the provided answer.  
4. Put the answer in single or double quotes when printing it.
5. Evaluate if the answer was short or long. Use different
   criteria for length (eg number of characters or words).
   Ask a broader question and insist on a longer answer.
6. Ask if the student visited the Python documentation 
   and a small quote from a specific section.
7. Which LLM does the student prefer? Print it is a good choice 
   if the LLM name is famous, ask for more detail if 
   it is a less known one.

## Course structure

The course proceeds with creating small building blocks that 
you should be able to reuse for the final program:

| Block           | Description                          | Link                          |

| `greet()`       | Hello and get the user name          | [Link](/task/greet)           |
| `motivate()`    | Try escape the `while` loop          | [Link](/task/motivate)        |
| `quote()`       | Fetch a quote to educate             |                               |
| `fill()`        | Fill in the blanks test              |                               |
| `verify()`      | True or false test                   |                               |
| `run_test()`    | Provide a random set of questions as a final test   |                |
| `score()`       | Calculate a score and give a letter grade (A-F)     |                |
| **Extras**      |                                      |                               |
| `randomize()`   | Pick a random emoji from a list      |                               |
| `count()`       | Offer a `2+2` excercise              |                               |
| `outline()`     | Print ornaments or underline headers                |                |
| `delay()`       | Make a user wait for the results but not too long   |                |
| `stamp()`       | Put a date on a test                 |                               |

| Real or not?    | Simplifications we made              |                               |
| What next?      | Ideas about program enhancements     |                               |

## Motivational quote

<img src="/elevated_tree2.png" alt="Tree Image" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">

Before starting a big journey, remember:

> A tree too big to embrace is created from the tiniest shoot.  
> A terrace of nine stories rises from a pile of dirt.  
> A journey of a thousand miles begins from under the feet.
