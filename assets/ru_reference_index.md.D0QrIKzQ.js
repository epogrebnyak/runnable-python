Statements can also span multiple lines.</p></li><li><p>Python uses <strong>indentation</strong> with extra spaces to define code blocks. Consistent indentation is required in Python to avoid errors.</p></li><li><p>You will learn to repeat a code block using <strong>loops</strong> and choose alternatives for program flow using <strong>conditional statements</strong>, or &quot;branching&quot;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comments</strong> in code provide additional information to the reader but do not affect program execution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functions</strong> and <strong>classes</strong> are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help in organizing and maintaining the code in a modular fashion.</p></li><li><p>You do need to write all of the code yourself — maybe there is already <strong>library</strong> or a <strong>package</strong> for your task. Maybe programming is just about connecting the dots porperly in services created and run by other people or organizations.</p></li></ul>',5)]))}const f=o(t,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
