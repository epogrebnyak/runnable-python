Greet-To-Grade: Start Python Excercises and Build Your Own Exam 
===============================================================

A beginner course that offers you code examples that you can write and run small Python programs right in your browser. 
The programs allow you to create a test bank and run your own exam program to get your final grade.

Levels
------

This course material is designed for non-technical students and organized by 
three levels of difficulty.

1. Entry level: Run provided examples and make small changes to the code to find out how it works and be able to explain it. Document existing code with comments or docstrings.

2. Intermediate level: Redesign programs and modify their behaviors to achieve new results according to a provided description or own specification.

3. Advanced level: Forecast the outcomes of programs over repeated runs using some theory or a simulation. Generalize code for reuse, make tests and refactor code for maintainability. Think of extensions for real-life cases.

Depending on students' prior programming background a specific course objective may be limited to the entry level or aim higher.
Advanced level tasks would be appropriate for technical students. 

Programming environment
-----------------------

The course website uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to enable Python to run in the browser without any installation needed.

There are several limitations:

- only the standard Python library is used,
- no files are created and there are no network requests,
- code not saved after closing the browser.

To save and extend your work you can install Python locally or use an online programming environment
similar to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/),
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces),
[Repl.it](https://replit.com/),
[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) or
[Yandex DataSphere](https://yandex.cloud/en/services/datasphere).

Pedagogy and motivation 
-----------------------

This course is a set of excercises in pure Python that aims to 

- be brief and achieve more with less code;
- cover all parts of basic Python syntax;
- enable students edit and run code quickly and encourage experimentation;
- stimulate to talk about code and to communicate;
- make connections to real life;
- project further learning path.
