Seven Pure Python Programs
==========================

A beginner course that makes you write and run small Python programs right in your browser (February 2025). 

Levels
------

This course material is designed for non-technical students at different levels of engagement into programming.

1. Entry level: Run provided examples and make small changes to the code to find out how it works and be able to explain it. Document existing code with comments or docstrings.

2. Intermediate level: Redesign programs and modify their behaviors to achieve new results according to a provided description or own specification.

3. Advanced level: Forecast the outcomes of programs over repeated runs using some theory or a simulation. Generalize code for reuse, make tests and refactor code for maintainability. Think of extensions for real-life cases.

Depending on students' prior programming background the course objective may be limited to the first level or aim higher.

Programming environment
-----------------------

The course website uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to enable Python to run in the browser without any installation needed.

There are several limitations:

- only the standard Python library is used,
- no files are created and there are no network requests,
- code not saved after closing the browser.

To save and extend your work you can choose an online programming environment
([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/),
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces),
[Repl.it](https://replit.com/),
[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/),
[Yandex DataSphere](https://yandex.cloud/en/services/datasphere))
or install Python locally.


Task list
---------

Version 0.1.0 (2025-02-09) 

The tasks start with a randomized greeting proceed to writing a code to grade the course final test.

1. Greet (but be discreet)
2. Motivate (never accept 'no' as an answer)
3. Count (with formulas and an adding machine)
4. Write text (and make it a contract)
5. Print (ornaments, shapes, and a maze)
6. Guess (make an educated one)
7. Assess (create your own 'true or false' tests)
