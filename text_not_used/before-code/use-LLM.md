Large language models (LLMs) are an exciting and promising area in artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI). There are powerful tools and assistants for learning and developing code. Start using them early and try out as many ideas
and experiments as you can. Aim to be a creator, not a cheater, as this mindset will establish you to be as augmented, not replaced by AI.

## Getting Started

The first step is to pick any language model with unrestricted access, such as [Deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/) or [Mistral](https://www.mistral.ai/), and start chatting with them about code. From there, you have two main paths: **cheating** or **building**.

## Cheating or Building

**Cheating** is making an LLM to do your job and presenting presenting it as your own work. Unless you are under any special pressure to do so, this approach is generally a waste of resources—yours, the course authors', instructors', and even the LLM load and tokens.

**Building**, on the other hand, involves using an LLM to enhance the code you have written yourself and thta you are able to run. Here are some ways you can use an LLM to build up your skills:

- talk at planning point before coding — before you code talk about the code you wank to build and go down to small working prototype, even a fucntion,
- evaluate and refactor — get the LLM to evaluate code quality and provide refactoring suggestions and alternatives,
- challenge yourself — ask the LLM to create additional tasks and exercises for you,
- document where LLM is wrong — new libraries, Python versions, or wrong answers,
- at more advanced level learn to deploy LLMs locally and use programmatic access
  to LLM through the APIs.

## Moving to Code Assistants

Once you are comfortable with chat-based LLMs, consider using assistants like:

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) (Mac only)
- [Replit Ghostwriter](https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter)
- [Aider](https://aider.chat/)

These tools provide extensive support for your coding projects.

## Limitations of LLMs

It's important to recognize a set of tasks that LLMs may not handle well, such as:

- higher-level planning;
- getting feedback from people and caring about people;
- making specifications for the task the real world context;
- designing experiments and evaluations;
- customization and differentiation form the average;
- generally, handling bigger uncertainty.

Getting better at thise tasks is your superb ability stay ahead of LLMs.

## Short LLM Glossary

_(Sorry we could not make the glossary serious enough.)_

- **AI**: Simulation of intelligence at human or even higher level using data,
  algorithms and exciting marketing slogans.

- **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules or protocols
  so that different pieces of software can talk to and work with each other.

- **ChatGPT**: A family of large language model developed by OpenAI (US)
  that broke ground in their mass adopton. Acquired 100 million new customers
  a record time of less than three months since the launch.

- **Copilot, assistant**: Tools like GitHub Copilot that distract developpers by making a
  promises to write code from text and fix bugs.

- **Deepseek**: A smart Chinese LLM that rivals OpenAI and is less expensive to make.

- **Frontier model**: An advanced language model that scores highest on benchmarks like [LMArena](https://lmarena.ai/). This typically refers to Gemini, OpenAI or Claude models, but be sure to check for updates as new powerful models come from big tech companies and smaller players.

- **HCI**: Human-Computer Interaction is an area of computer science and software engineering that studies how people interact with computers and computers with people. It seems using LLM as an interface is safer than as a decision-maker.

- **LLM**: Large Language Model is neural network that accepts incoming text and throughs
  out whatever seems a more natural continuation for this text. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data from all over Internet to predict the next word in a sentence. 

- **Neural net**: A neural network is a system of parameters (weights) organized into an architecture of layers and interconnections. Difficult to trace or interpret how it works due to large number of parameters. Neural networks are good at recognizing patterns, making decisions that they cannot be held accountable for, and are hungry for new data and computing capacity to be able to train and run.

- **Open model**: Some LLM are freely available for use on your own or server computer, although you still need a fairly powerful machine. The most well known open model is LLaMA, and Hugging Face is a leading platform for open models distribution.

- **Prompt**: In LLM world a prompt is the initial input, question or command given to the model to generate a response. It guides the model's output based on the provided context.

- **Prompt engineering**: the art of talking to an LLM using prompts. Gets slightly irrelevant nad outdated by the time a new model arrives.

- **Transformer**: A model architecture introduced in the "Attention is All You Need" paper, that is highly effective for natural language processing. Overlooked by Google as inital author and used by rival OpenAI to create ChatGPT.
