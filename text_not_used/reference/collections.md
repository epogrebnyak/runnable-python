# Compound data structures

## List

Mind model:

- A collection of many values of the same type
- Mutable
- Provide examples of a list

Basic operations:

- Syntax to create using [] and commas
- Refer an item by zero-based index
- Refer to items using slices
- Add an new item to list
- Change an item on the list

More operations:

- List comprehensions
- Generating number sequences with range() function

## Tuple

Mind model

- A few values of the same or different types
- Immutable
- What is a tuple useful for?

Operations

- Syntax to create using () and commas
- Access to items and unpacking

Extra questions

- To we want to name fields in a tuple?
- Is a list of tuples useful?

## Dictionary

Mind model:

- Mapping of keys to values
- Significance - an extremely useful data structure
- So many things are represented as dictionary!

Operations:

- Syntax to create using {}, : and commas
- Adding, changing and dropping elements

## Review: operations with compound data structures

- Using `list`, `tuple` and `dict` constructor
- Access an element by an index or key
- Iterate over the elements
- Concatenate or join two data structures
- Using in comprehensions
- Nested data structures
