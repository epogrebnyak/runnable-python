## Modern Python Toolchain

The ["Hypermodern Python Packaging"](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) blog series by Claudio Jolowicz 
nicely depicts the Pyhton packaging and productivity toolchain. 
The blog was originally published in 2020 and now made it into a 
[book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hypermodern-python-tooling/9781098139575/).

A table below summarizes the current Python toolchian.

::: info Ð¡hanges since the blog (in _Newer_ column)

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) from Astral are very fast and useful.
- [mkdocs-material] is a vibrant project that offers a great documentation and static sites theme.
- For type checking [pyright] is a good supplement to [mypy].
