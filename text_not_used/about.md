**Python Survival Guide (PSG)** allows both students and instructors 
to survive and excel in a beginner course in Python.

You can start learning Python and run your first Python program [right here](/).

## What this guide provides

1. In-browser programming environment that does not need any installation or setup,
   just the browser.
2. A custom [Python language reference](/reference/index.md) tailored to a beginner course.
3. [Instructor handbook](/docs/instuctor-manual) and [a student checklist](/resources).
4. Suggestions for Python best practices and [modern tools](/docs/reference/tools.md).

<!-- must match the TOC !-->

## Use cases

The guide is designed to support individual or group learning and targets the following use cases:

- As a **teacher**, you can go into the classroom, load the guide into a browser
  for yourself and your students and start the excercises.

- As a **student**, you can use the guide for self-paced learning and practice, as well as making your own roadmap.

- As a **competent programmer**, you can share better exercises with learners.

## Broader vision

Python should be easy to learn and enable you to pick up good coding and reasoning habits, join or create communities, identify tasks and areas where programming makes you more productive, put your new skills at work.

Barriers to this goal are also high (there are many prerequisites, learning thinking 
as a programmer is harder than just syntax, need persistence and focus, etc.) and returns of  basic programming on the current job market are diminishing (growth of AI assistants 
and oversupply of junior-level programmers).

Python can serve as an additional tool for creating automation scripts, 
handling data, making and using APIs, running LLM and AI agents, and developing 
small software prototypes. This is particularly important in the humanities and social sciences domains, as well as in for fostering reproducible academic research.

The future of programming may not be entirely in traditional IT roles,
where the job market and business models are under under pressure,
but the next level of programming literacy for non-IT industries
and academic research. It remains to be seen if this bet will pay off.

## Roadmap

Status by chapter:

- ‚≠ê ok for now
- üèì needs edit or review, whole section may change
- ‚úçüèª the section stays in place, content editing
- üöµüèª in the roadmap
- üóø not for the current version 

Critical:

- License: set more permissive license and rules for distribution.
- Bring to classroom soon in Spring 2025 semester.

Enhancements:

- favicon
- Front page: bring back the front page with code and blocks of text.

New features:

- Assessment center: assessment service for grading students can be a useful addition for the guide.
- Translations: we hope to follow up with national language versions of this course, including Hindi, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic, Spanish, French and Russian.
